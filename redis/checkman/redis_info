 This plugin checks for redis info parameters

 The check becomes {critical} or {warning} if there are defined
 levels reached.

 This is a inventorized check and will create one service for
 every info parameter found. Default no warn or critical values
 are set and no graphs will be created unless the corresponding
 service is configured via WATO.
